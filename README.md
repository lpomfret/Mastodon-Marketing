# Mastodon Marketing Academics

This repository provides a most simple web app that helps to bulk follow marketing and consumer behaviour scholars on the FOSS microblogging service Mastodon. In it you can create a csv-file that can be uploaded in any accounts mastodon seetings, in order to follow a list of accounts at once.

## Can I use this for my discipline/peer group?

Yes, basically you just have to fork the original [Sociologists on Mastodon repro](https://trutzig89182.github.io/Mastodon-Sociologists/) and make some minor changes. That's exactly what we did to create this one!
